    "This feature selection notebook does a filter followed by a wrapper for a binary dependent variable (binary classification). It's capable of doing the filter on more than one file. The variable files are called vars1.csv, vars2.csv ... Or you can make the input file name(s) anything you want. The filter runs separately on each vars file and keeps the top num_filter variables from each file. If there are more than one vars files we'll again select the top num_filter variables across all the vars.csv files.\n",

    "Things to modify if you use this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things simple arrange your data so that the rare class has the label 1 and the \n",
    "common class has the label 0. You can do the reverse if you want but then you need to modify more things in this code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important parameters are in cell 2 and 20. The main ones you should try experimenting with are num_out_of_filter and num_out_of_wrapper. In cell 2 you should set the name of the record identifying number (it's good to use a record number to keep track of things) and the name of the binary dependent variable. This particular version is set for a fraud problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure your validation/out-of-time population and any other record exclusion is set correctly and as you want for your problem in cell 3. This define the records in the data file that you for whatever reason you don't want to include in your feature selection process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cell 20 has the SequentialFeatureSelector (SFS) settings. You can try different wrapper models with different amounts of commplexity. You can select either forward or backward. The filter is pretty fast. The wrapper is what takes the most time. I find forward selection runs much faster than backward.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a parameter njobs that controls the # threads used in the wrapper. Set it to 1 for a single thread and it should work fine, but you might be able to succeed with njobs = -1, which lets the machine set the maximum # threads based on the CPU. With this setting the kernel may die because of memory. The njobs = -1 doesn't take into consideration the memory requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations: Try a few simple runs just to make sure all's working. Start with num_out_of_filter = 20, num_out_of_wrapper = 5, increase from there. I like num_out_of_filter as high as around 10% to 20% of the # candidate variables, but not much higher than a few hundred. You don't need num_out_of_wrapper large if you're doing forward selection. Most problems will saturate before 20. You can try a few different simple wrapper models like RF (5 trees, 10 layers), catboost (10 trees, 3 layers), LGBM (same). They're pretty fast. You can try forward and backward. I'd start with forward. In the end, select one of these as your favorite run and go with those variables. Don't mix variables across different runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If balance = 0 the entire files are used. If balance != 0 then balance is the RATIO OF BADS TO GOODS retained for the rest of the feature selection. We keep all the rare class (bads) and downsample the goods. I think in general it's better to keep balance = 0."
